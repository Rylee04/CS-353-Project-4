The player starts with an empty inventory and finds certain items in each area.
  Produce - apple, banana, tomato
  Snack Aisle - chips, cookies, candy

The end state of the game is to reach checkout with at least 4 inventory items (detailed again in-game when using the Describe Area action at Checkout).
Actions are always listed every "turn."
